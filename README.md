# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the Analysis
Pewlett Hackard is a large company with a large number of employees. They are looking to identify, quantitatively, the number of individuals coming upon retirement.
If they are able to identify that number then that will allow them to better realize what positions will need to be filled in the near term, along with beginning a mentorship
program for those who may take their place internally. The following is representative of the ask:
	
	1. Determine the number of employees approaching retirement.
	2. Determine what roles will need to be filled.
	3. Develop a mentorship program.
	4. Understand how many employees will be eligible for said mentorship program.

## Summary
As seen in the results there are a total of 74,458 people coming up on retirement. Though there is a moderate spread in number of employees retiring in each specific role, there are two that will be the most demanding to fill, and that is
the Senior Staff and Senior Engineering roles. 

Given the total number of employees retiring, and the total number of employees eligible for the mentorship program, there will be a large number of unfilled roles; however, if they are willing there are enough retiring employees who could
mentor were they to work part-time.

To further the analysis and provide better clarity I created 2 additional tables with details below:


	-This table will allow leadership to see the total quantity of eligible employees by title. This could help align staffing in those specific roles.

	-This table will allow leadership to filter eligible employees specifically by title and department.
